This repository hosts the R package [conformalInference.fd](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/conformalInference.fd/index.html) (now available on CRAN), a powerful tool for generating valid prediction regions at levels 1-α or 1-2α, specifically designed for multiple functional response regression.

Unlike traditional methods, conformalInference.fd offers a non-parametric approach that embraces the complexity of functional data. It allows you to perform regression analysis without assuming any specific parametric form for the underlying data distribution. This flexibility enables accurate predictions and insights in a wide range of real-world applications.

Developed as part of my MSc. final thesis in Mathematical Engineering at Politecnico di Milano, conformalInference.fd extends the core methods of Conformal Prediction for regression in the univariate response case to handle the unique challenges posed by multiple functional response data.

## Code Structure

The package is organized into three main families of functions, providing a comprehensive framework for efficient and flexible functional response regression analysis:

1. Prediction methods: These functions compute prediction regions, empowering you to make accurate predictions with confidence.
2. Regression methods: This family of functions allows for the incorporation of custom-coded regression algorithms, providing users with flexibility in choosing the most suitable method for their prediction tasks. Additionally, the package includes the implementation of common regression methods.
3. Plot methods: Visualize and interpret the output of prediction methods using the plot functions provided in this package.

By separating the regression methods from the prediction methods, conformalInference.fd offers users the freedom to tailor their regression analysis to their specific needs, ensuring ultimate flexibility and customization.
